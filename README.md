Analysis of Covid-19 Time Series Data from Johns Hopkins  
  
This R Markdown document imports CSV files with Covid-19 case data collected by Johns Hopkins during the pandemic.  
  
The following steps were applied.  
1. Import the data.  
2. Remove unnecessary columns.  
3. Rename columns and convert data types.  
4. Join files to create useful data sets (in R data frames).  
5. Remove unnecessary data, such as records where the number of cases were less than zero.  
6. Summarize the data.  
7. Visualize the summarized data with graphs.  
8. Apply a linear model to the data to determine whether the model would be a reliable predictor.  
9. Share conclusions and caveats.
